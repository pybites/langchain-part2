       "[Document(page_content=\"hello and welcome to the pi blights podcast where we talk about python career and mindset we're your hosts I'm Julian sequira and I am Bob belderboss if you're looking to improve your python your career and learn the mindset for Success this is the podcast for you let's get started [Music] welcome back to the pi bytes podcast episode 130 this is Bob and I'm here with Julian how's it going man it's happening good Monday recording day I'm excited what do I do yeah I'm very excited I'm drinking out of my Star Wars mug because the uh Ahsoka show is out on Disney Plus I'm very excited and happy about that awesome yeah I forgot my water so I have to uh wait for a little bit all right well let's uh let's see we're gonna keep this one pretty quick well we always say that and it's super quick but uh let's kick off kick it off with some wins talk to me um yeah no I um was reading um deep work again I'm still reading them just because I'm reading many books I just you know take it in small chunks but one thing that really stuck with me was like batching similar things so I put all my coaching check-ins for example on Tuesday and Friday and I do most of the content creation on Monday hence we're recording now under the email so blocking things like that makes me more productive and gives me more peace of mind so I think that's a productivity win oh awesome man yeah I love it you see you definitely way more on top of your uh chunking which is uh trunking very very cool that's the word yeah what about you uh personal one this uh this time well it's always a personal one with me but a mindset win so yesterday was Father's Day so happy Father's Day to you Australian Father's Day so I got two you got two yeah you better wish me and much uh so we we had a fantastic day my wife planned a massive surprise um where we just followed these random instructions to drive around like it was it's one one of the cards said just drive whichever way the wind is blowing and we ended up at a beautiful beach and we had a picnic and it was lovely uh so that was a win in itself just a beautiful day uh but I have to share it because it's kind of in hindsight It's Kind of a Funny Story but um while we were sitting there we're almost done the picnic you know the food's kind of there's little bits of food left in the plastic containers and these two Maltese Terrier dogs ran up the beach their owner had taken them off the leash they ran up um we couldn't stop them they just Dove straight into the middle of the picnic sand all over everything all over the food their faces and their feet in the food it was uh look we were mortified in the moment I was like my wife was definitely thinking it's ruined and uh I'm sitting here going blue ocean just there's no point getting angry it's it's done you can't Salvage the food it's done so anyway it all worked out we had a fantastic day after that as well with lots more exploring and and uh just discovering things and uh it was it was just lovely it was a fantastic day but that was that was definitely a highlight slash low light but no it's a funny story so we had a good day it's good Father's Day that's my win yeah I like how uh it went from the mindset of when it happened to now you're actually laughing about it but in a moment it's pretty terrible right yeah the the message I left you yesterday telling you about it at a slightly different uh tone to it I'm pretty sure exactly exactly yeah so good mindsets raining yeah exactly um so look with with today everyone thank you for for being here as always thank you for listening to our inane rambling sometimes uh but today we wanted to talk a little bit about uh just just what's happening with python and um that it really is time I think and this is a nice way of framing it if I do say so myself I think this is a good time for us to start changing our opinions as developers and people and non-tech people and everything that python is something that's only for the technically literate and Bob you can carry on from here what what's driving this thought process with us well it's being used Now everywhere and also maybe in areas where you would less so expect it so we had that big news about Microsoft Excel adopting python super exciting I wanted to try it out right away but then turns out it was for Windows and had to go on a waiting list so I will be notified and I probably will need an awareness machine but um that's super exciting right because Excel as far as I know was always like VBA and a different programming language basically and now we can use Python there as well so although python was already huge it's still finding new areas and being expended um to you know areas where non-python Developers where it might be interesting for them to to pick it up right yeah yeah exactly and that that's what gets me excited if if you really think about the magnitude of it right I mean it's now going to be native to the application you don't need to have plugins you don't need to do all these other things on the outside you don't need to uh use you know Open PI Excel or whatever other languages like Java and what have you might be using you know it's in the app and it took a little while for me to even as I was reflecting on it to think just how big that is of every language out there this is the one that Microsoft has chosen to put into the application that essentially runs the world you know if you were to think cloud runs all the infrastructure the application that runs the planet is Excel every company on the planet uses it and whether you're technically literate or not you would be using it in your workplace at some point you know and so to me that's very exciting because this is along the same thought process as AI um if you learn it and you learn to use it in conjunction with your day job it can give you a leg up over everyone else so the way I'm thinking is non-tech people say people who in roles such as and I'm generalizing here right not everyone's non-tech but the traditional non-technologically based roles such as recruiting sales marketing you know the ones that you wouldn't necessarily bring up the command line in SSH into a host right those roles are suddenly being exposed to programming interfaces languages and such so if you as someone in one of these roles and you're dealing with Oodles of data whether it's Human Resources data metrics uh recruiting data whatever it happens to be even sales data you don't have to just stick to the basic Excel graphs you don't have to just stick to uh you know trying to build getting someone else to build pipelines outside of excel to feed your Excel document with data you can actually learn to do this yourself with python it's such a an engaging language that can draw you in very easily and you can learn it and just have this leg up you can be self-sufficient and that's super exciting that's that's very exciting to me which is why I wanted to just mention it today indeed yeah super exciting and full circle for me as well as I started in finance I started to learn to program VBA and now went to Python and now python is in Excel so yeah um we're mind blown but yeah um good point so how can we help people that are completely new and in other sectors to start uh python so this worked out to be the perfect plug for our pdoi program the pi bytes developer initialization program or init program that we we launched in July I think it was and um we've had our first round of people that have gone through the six weeks they've now completed it and we wanted to mention it it was the perfect tie-in with this announcement from Microsoft that hey this is a great time for people who are traditionally non-tech to be learning python so Bob um what were the kinds of backgrounds of the people that have gone through the program and can you just share quickly what are some of the sort of takeaways results wins that you have top of mind yeah sure um so most people we've worked with that didn't have any or very slim programming experience so for example our own Georgia went through the program she didn't know anything about programming after a few weeks she was doing git from the command line she built her to do app which is one of the Capstone projects we have um and I'm really I'm really impressed with how well she has done and how she picked it up and I think it's all because of the deliberate practice right people have to we do a small round of bridging gaps and then they have to work on projects as soon as possible of course radar coaching and guidance um we had somebody that's uh in sales right and he knew already a bit of programming but he also Incorporated flask so that's kind of the nice thing as well about PDI is that although we have a curriculum and it's pretty structured and guided if people want to bring in more advanced stuff more advanced than a typical beginner Pro program then they can right we're you can make it as advanced as they want so we did some flash some SQL model as well for Georgia as well by the way for database persistence um yeah um way more confident in his skills more autonomous not only building apps but also and there's another example of more sophistic more sophisticated tooling brought in he was also using chat GPT um so a bit hesitant at the start but then with my guidance because I was coaching him he just he's now using that um a lot for his coaching school day to day so there's a couple examples right yeah that's amazing man and uh just with Georgia if you're listening to this you should be I'm kidding uh Georgia is our EA by the way our executive assistant and she uh when I got back from Canada was telling me Oh yeah yeah I just open a branch for this feature request I'm like wait what did you just say to me you what happened what happened while I was going this it's uh it's been a huge turnaround on that that level and I'm very excited and then you know coming in the next two weeks I think um we've got a recruiter avarian Emily going through the program as well and you know Emily doesn't have she was on the podcast by the way for all of you listening a couple of weeks ago uh but she doesn't have a tech background with regards to command line shell proms um get anything like that she has no idea about those things so it's going to be very exciting for her to go through it so and she's got a recruiting background so for me it's very very exciting to see people that aren't traditionally Tech nuts you know like us going through and scaling up on Python and to some extent it's it's arguably even more exciting than helping people with the existing skill set because we're showing people who never would have believed in a million years that they could code that actually it is possible and they can develop whatever the heck they want so that's very exciting to me yep no it's it's super exciting and a lot of people also use there's a bridge to the PDM program right so they see the PDM program is something Advanced they're not ready for so they go through PDI first to bridge all the gaps and then be ready to when the join PDM to go extra fast and do you have any um were there any wins that they shared throughout that time that you can remember certainly in spdn that's a part of a process right to every week list out the wins um as we also call it the successful or we will we can make an article about why that's important below so yeah a couple of wins so complete a project on my own and got incredible useful feedback with how to refactor my coach I noticed like although it's a beginner program we're already going into refactoring uh week two I'm getting more and more comfortable using kit in the command line so it's not just git and vs code we endorse the command line learn about pip tools and pre-commit there's a huge win this costs a Django project so apart from the Capstone project this person is doing a Auto projects on the side right so really committed to awesome coaching sessions um which always leave me excited and encouraged to learn more pricing because not only about the technical stuff in those sessions also like the persistence and and accountability and keeping people on track right and then another thing I wanted to share with an overall win after somebody completed a program or two big takeaways and that was a learned how to write code efficiently and in a real world environment and I learned basically software development thinking and tooling I think that's the important thing about that is like we really simulate that Real World experience which is really hard to get from tutorials and guides and um in regards to software developments not only to coding right it's also the tooling um as per the other wins pre-commit and and pip compile and all these things but also the thinking right we don't have you just code we always guide you with that design with thinking about how to write efficient and maintainable software yeah exactly and it's kind of funny you just reminded me one of my mates was reaching out and actually said to me you know how do I learn python man I need to learn it all these jobs that I'm applying for say python on it in some way shape or form and I said look man um you got to sign up for a coaching and you know that's the thing sometimes your instinct is to just be a bit sheepish with the people that you know about this stuff uh but I I believe in this so much I said you could take months to take some online courses and maybe mess around with a book and do the same little gimmicky projects of hello world and all that sort of stuff right you can you can do that if you really want I said but man I I know your situation I know what you're trying to do um six weeks pdoi join it you're going to come out exactly where you need to be right so uh it's very exciting to me what what people are achieving through this program um so one one last thing for me before we move on and wrap this up uh because clearly we want to talk about just python now being such a big thing for everyone right it's not just for developers and people who want coding jobs this is now it's it's like learning a new language like English in the workplace or whatever right so what I'm asking from everyone listening to this is to please please please do not just us a favor but do that your network a favor do the people in your lives a favor your family your friends your people you know in University people you know in these uh I'll say it again traditional non-tech roles right reach out to them and let them know that python is something they need to learn right recommend our coaching program you know support them support us that would be awesome I would I would love that I'd appreciate it but more importantly I want to see people believing in themselves and not being left behind I don't want to see people uh losing their jobs and becoming obsolete because you have programming starting to become a central theme across the world through and I want to say this Excel thing is is a massive driver of that and will be a driver of that um that sets people apart you know so please do ever in a favor um I would really appreciate I know you would too Bob uh but please share this out let them know that this is something that's coming and it's something they can actually learn and that we can help them learn it I'd appreciate that nice thanks yeah let's go I was going to mention the same thing and then you did uh the other thing I want to call out is the AI tools right church upd and Friends becoming more um you know widespread and not only in programming but in all Fields right so and that's it working with us you really develop that mindset to embrace those tools and become more effective so it's not only about the python developer kills it's also about the productivity mindset and career and stuff um that are yeah that people really get out of of working with us yep perfect yeah all right well that's that's that go get that off my chest yeah we'll do a quick book right you go first because you go first because I need to go to powerbitesbooks.com that was the most obese plug of this entire episode so thank you I really don't know what I read so um I actually haven't read anything new uh because I'm still reading that uh the climate change book that I mentioned on the last episode I was on whatever that was called I can't remember uh carbon the carbon Almanac that's the one so you could tell from the word Almanac that's gonna be a big book so I'm um I'm still working my way through that and in between you know I'm I'm not ashamed I'm proud of it I'm reading my Marvel unlimited subscription making my way through a bunch of uh Doctor Strange Comics at the moment so there you go love it all right what do you reading tell me uh well first of all you got me on Audible so thank you yes um the Spanish collection um is much much better now um so you have this Netflix model of um consume whatever you want um so it's nice for boxing stuff it even incentivizes moving more doing more steps um but on the reading side I want to recommend The Four Agreements by uh Don Miguel Ruiz um and it's really a mindset book right it's about uh self-limiting beliefs um creating needless suffering so it has some really good tips around that and um yeah so it's a pretty short read you can probably read it in a day or weekend and um yeah it was pretty inspiring nice that's cool man yeah make sure we have links for those um in the show notes uh all right well before we wrap it up uh everyone thank you as always one thing I'll ask you to do as well go check out the pi bytes website uh and the PDM page and the PDI page uh Bob and I have done a lot of work over the past week and we have Rewritten Rewritten everything so it's much more lean uh to the point and very very factual so head in there and uh check it out uh we're definitely proud of the work that's been put into that so yeah yeah the pages are really 2.0 now so Pi bid.es uh way more concise way more informative we spend some good time on that and um you should know in a couple of minutes just get all the relevant information um have nice looking FAQs as well and it's it's uh yeah put a lot of effort in that yep yeah cool we'll even have a video on the home page soon won't we oh yeah yeah that's awesome yeah he's just constantly iterating all right well thanks everyone for listening um this is all next week thanks what's up next week some I think it's coding related I think everyone needs a nice uh shot of code yeah I uh I think we're going to uh well us or me to talk about code smells so stay tuned for that yeah I'm looking forward to that one that'll be good beautiful thanks for listening everyone Bob thank you chat I enjoyed it yeah as always and thanks everybody for tuning in and we'll be back next week ciao we hope you enjoyed this episode to hear more from us go to Pi bite friends that is pibit.es slash friends and receive a free gift just for being a friend of the show and to join our thriving slack community of python programmers go to Pi bytes slash Community that's Pi bit.es forward slash community we hope to see you there
